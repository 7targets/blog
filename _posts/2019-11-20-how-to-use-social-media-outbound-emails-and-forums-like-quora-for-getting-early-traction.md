We often create special landing pages mainly for specific conversions. All that brainstorming and effort put into creating the best quality landing pages that convert is a tough job. But, your landing pages, no matter how amazing they are, will not be helpful unless you drive traffic to your landing pages.

We tend to think of all the ways that involve spending a lot money assuming that after having spent all that money, traffic is bound to start flowing in.

Turns out, it’s not true. It does not work for everyone or maybe you are just not making up for all that money spent.

Use these simple techniques that will drive traffic to your landing pages and are also easy on your pocket.

## Social Media 
#### Analysis
You may not have enough followers to pull traffic to your landing pages but you can definitely optimise your social media content to reach a larger audience. Begin with carefully constructing your posts and more importantly selecting the right hashtags for your posts. You can very effectively use these hashtags to drive traffic that’s closely related to your target audience. Quickly analyse the followers for the selected hashtags and make required variations. 

#### Posting
Create a logical connect between your posts and hashtags to entice your user’s interest that does not put them off with posts having irrelevant hashtags.

#### Engagement
Why always think of driving new traffic to our landing pages when we can have our existing express interest in our new offerings. Be swift to reply to all social media visitors,engage with them and build long term relations. Existing all more likely to express their interest in your latest offerings as opposed to new customers. On Twitter, follow people, and they will follow you to. Only thing to remember is to follow the right people, so that _thier_ network conversions are valuable to you. 

#### Scheduling
Use scheduling tools like HootSuite, Ryzely, Buffer to schedule your posts so that you are always active. 

## Use communities or question and answer sites like Quora  
Quora, when used correctly, can help you drive traffic to your landing pages quite usefully. Find questions that are relevant to your pages and answer them informatively. However the catch here is, never answer their query completely. Leave them asking for more. Slip in a link to your page. This will definitely drive traffic to your landing page given that you were able to build a good narrative and interest the visitors.

We also can’t overlook the fact that Google does show Quora’s results in it’s search results giving visibility to your answer and driving traffic.

#### Outbound email campaigns
Now this is one technique marketers often consider to have lost it’s essence. However, emails continue to have the best response ratio and we don’t want to miss out on them.

You are running various outbound email campaigns, from classic to smart, with proper scheduled emails. But you don’t have these emails fulfilling your purpose of sending them out.
