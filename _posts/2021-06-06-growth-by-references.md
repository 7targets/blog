Growth by Reference is a dream for many organizations. How to get your users to refer someone else to use your product? Why does someone refer a product even when there is no money involved for him/her?
What is at stake from a users perspective? 

## Delight, show 10x value

Customer delight is the #1 reason of why someone refers others potential leads to you. Whenever you exceed customers expectation, it creates a positive emotional reaction. Customer delight makes users remember your product. Meeting expectations does not yield in customer delight. Think about showcasing results in a more delightful way. Recommending some steps accurately Vs user typing the same steps can also delight a user as he experiences the intelligence of the software.

## Amazing customer support

Great customer service means following best practices like valuing customers time, having a pleasant attitude, sharing the excitement that you have towards solving a problem and providing knowledgeable insights. If the client is having trouble using your software, just don't ignore the point where your product is lacking. Make sure that the problem is acknowledged first and then look into solving it. Customers get the full experience of using your software if your support also provides tips on whats new, how others are deriving value, along with solving existing problem at hand. 

## Be clear about where you're not an expert

If you're not an expert on something, do not try to own that issue. Only when you're super strong or comfortable handling the issue, then you'll end up delighting the person you're working with. Set right expectations if you are not an expert. Get back to someone by getting an expert to solve the issue as you remain the point of contact while issue is getting solved. Dont have the user repeat the problem to numerous other people. 

Trying to solve issues outside your expertise often results in a bad reputation.

## Network Growth is side effect, not a focused goal

Never make network growth your goal. It's more like a side effect. If you grow your network forcefully, the quality of your network will be poor. If network growth is a result of your good work, the quality of your network will be high, outcome of your network will be immense.
Kind actions create long term relationships. Helpful intent is key. The more you come across as a salesperson, the less you will sell.
