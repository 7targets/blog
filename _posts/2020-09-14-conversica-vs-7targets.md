AI Sales Assistant or Virtual SDR are helping get the consistency and reliability in the Sales process. AI Sales Assistant market is growing and each product is taking its perspective to provide the value for their customer. Below are some important expectations one has from the AI Sales Assistant.

- Ability to write and read emails
- Based on the email response decide the conversational path
- Remind the Sales people too
- Go hyper personalized in terms of email sending time

Below is a honest attempt to compare Conversica and 7Targets AI Sales Assistant on above and few more attributes.

## Ability to write and read emails
Assistant would be able to write focused first and the followup emails. Making sure of ~5 second read, to the point emails. Executive do not have much time, so the focus on to the point and small emails increases the readability. Assistant should be able to pick the right subject too. 

Conversica is in this from sometime now, so surely **has a matured AI model** and process for this. 7Targets is not far behind too.  
Almost all of our existing customers want to write there first emails themselves and many let the Assistant write the followup emails. The flexibility of letting user write there own custom message and pick the custom sequence of email for advanced user would possibly **score at par if not above** Conversica. 

## Based on the email response decide the conversational path
7Targets AI Assistant's AI model is able to detect Out of Office(OOO) almost all the time, with this the Assistant would be able to send the next email at the time when the lead is back to office. Beyond OOO, there are other important conversational capabilities to continue the conversation. No doubt, Conversica is matured in identifying correct intent in the email response, again because of the time they are working on this. 
7Targets has taken a conscious approach of letting the human being respond back in case of leads response. The reason for taking this approach is to avoid accidentally wrong emails in 2nd and 3rd level conversations. Finally AI is machine and can interpret wrong. 7Targets Assistant responds only when someone asks for brochure. 7Targets is continuously investing in improving the AI model to be able to identify more intents from the email responses.

## Remind the Sales people too
7Targets customers requested us for a feature where the Assistant should followup with the Sales people in case they forgot to respond back to a lead who responded. Conversica has this feature of identifying a LEad at Risk but reminding the sales about it is critical and allowing to mark it off or changing the frequency on each such lead **scores high** for 7Targets. 

## Go hyper personalized in terms of email sending time
Ability to understand the email reading timings and sending further followup emails is critical to getting the leads attention and possible response. 7Targets Assistant does come with this skill. Not sure of this functionality in Conversica at the time of writing this blog. 

## Some other important aspects and features:

**Nurturing Table:** Concept of Nurturing table and each assistant's ability to have it own Industry specific Nurturing table gives the edge to the 7Targets assistant. It is important to get a 100% problem area coverage for your target profile so that small bits of knowledge can eb shared with the lead. This approach is proven to work well and get the lead engaged more. Yes one can have multiple assistants per user. [Read more](https://help.7targets.com/getting-responses/assistant-nurturing/)
