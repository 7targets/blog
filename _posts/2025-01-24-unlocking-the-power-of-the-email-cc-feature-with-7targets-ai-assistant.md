#### How the Email CC Feature Works

1. **CC the Assistant:** When you compose an email, simply add the AI assistant to the CC field. This action triggers the automation process.  
     
2. **Automated Follow-ups:** Once CCed, the assistant takes charge of the follow-up process. It reaches out to leads as necessary, ensuring timely communication.  
     
3. **Response Management:** The assistant automatically halts follow-ups once a lead responds. This feature ensures that your communication remains efficient and relevant.

### Benefits of Using the Email CC Feature

#### Increased Response Rates

One of the standout benefits of the Email CC feature is its ability to significantly boost response rates. For example, **Shreeji Pharma** saw an impressive **68% growth** in responses after implementing the AI Assistant's follow-up capabilities. This remarkable increase positioned them as the top performer in their group, surpassing all other human efforts combined.

#### Automated Follow-ups for Efficiency

The **AI Sales Assistant** streamlines the follow-up process, allowing sales teams to concentrate on closing deals rather than chasing leads. This automation not only saves valuable time but also ensures that leads receive timely communication. As a result, the chances of conversion are greatly enhanced.

**Shreeji Pharma** gets leads from various sources like IndiaMart and social media. If a lead does not close, they used to drop the lead from their funnel. With AI Assistant, if a lead does not close, he continues to get nurtured about once a month (configurable). In **Shreeji Pharma** case, nurturing is about sharing this months pricing of different Pharma products. A lead, who once is in the system, can always consider coming back after looking at the prices. 

Meaningful followups are more important than normal followups. This is a good example of that. 

### Managing Lead Responsiveness with AI Sales Assistant

#### Identifying LEAD\_AT\_RISK

The AI Assistant is equipped to monitor lead responsiveness effectively. If a lead is responsive but the internal salesperson is not, the assistant flags the lead as **LEAD\_AT\_RISK**. This proactive approach ensures that no potential opportunity is overlooked.

#### Continuous Internal Follow-ups

The assistant continues to follow up internally until the lead is responded to. This feature keeps the sales team engaged and informed about the status of their leads. Maintaining momentum in the sales process is crucial, and this capability ensures that no lead is left unattended.
